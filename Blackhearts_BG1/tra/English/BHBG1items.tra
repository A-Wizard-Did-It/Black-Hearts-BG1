@22=~Humanbane Bastard Sword~
@23=~Also known as the hand-and-a-half sword, the bastard sword derives its name from the fact that it is halfway between the two-handed sword and the long sword. 

This old, beaten up sword has been given a bane enchantment, making it particularly effective in slaying humans. Blood seems to permanently stain its chipped blade. Even just holding such a weapon is often considered a sign of the wielder's wickedness, but practicality and virtue are rarely easy companions.

@27=~This heavy tome contains Sazazir's spells and writings. Most of it is indecipherable, though you were able to strip out a few of the pages with spells that could be scribed from it. Near as you can tell, the rest of the book is mostly composed of the rantings of a madman; scared witless about some sort of accountant from a former cult of his who was intent on murdering him. There are also several passages about how he was often frightened to near paralysis by the thought that his own skeleton would be the one to betray him next.

@35=~Tome of Manuscripts~
@36=~This tome contains the manuscripts of the playwright (and rumored Harper) Salena Fairsky, including such popular plays as "The Merryweather Conundrum" and "Whisper the Six". 

Salena's plays are well known for being beautifully written with characters that explore cyclical themes of humanoid-nature. Critics however have often panned her work for being overwrought and with a reliance on deus ex machina endings to resolve central conflicts in the play.

The last few pages contain Salena's last unfinished play, titled "Black Heart". It details a woman named the “Cardinal” as she courts "The Pale Man", who had murdered her family when she was only a child, in the hopes of using the relationship to destroy him. The play seemed to be moving for a tragic turn as the Cardinal's efforts draw her down a dark path, her actions becoming more extreme and compromising her morals little by little until she became just like the man she so hated. The story abruptly stops without any hint for where the ending might have gone.~

@81=~This leather armor is lined with silken strands of spiderwebs that provide both excellent protection as well as a curious secondary effect; when the wearer of the armor is struck, the webs spray out over his attacker, binding them in webbing for a short time. This works even when struck by ranged attackers.

Status Report - We've continued to monitor the situation in Baldur's Gate closely. I believe your suspicions about something major happening here were not unfounded. The Iron Throne continues to manipulate the region and consolidate their power. It would be wise to establish a partnership with them now, they seem like the type that would happily pay good coin for our services.

We’ve also spied a Red Wizard enclave in the midst of the city. We believe that they’re aligned with the Iron Throne, although as you’ve said, intel states that there’s no formalized relationship between the two entities. From our own investigations, the Red Wizards here are led by a woman named Cherise, a woman with a curious history from our findings. She is among the old order of cultists, like many that we’ve been ordered to eliminate from our client in the region. It could be tricky if we’re asked to assassinate her, and I will of course defer to your judgment on if we should proceed or not.

As an addition to this status report, we now hold in our possession a Harper agent we were informed would be snooping around. It’s frustrating that we were instructed to hold her in good health when extracting her Harper secrets could be so much more amusing. I can tell you, I dislike working for a client who has more secrets than we do. With that said, we are close to a breakthrough on that as well. Soon we’ll have their ident-

@92=~Borrowed Fortune~
@93=~Loyle Nosbrun was a prodigious gambler, a man who never left home without making a wager, and never returned home without making two more. While such a lifestyle is surely a path to disaster for most, Loyle always found a way out or an unexpected turn of fortune that settled his debts so he could live to gamble another day. Some attributed this unnatural luck to the gaudy sword he wore at his hip, one which he never seemed to be without. 

However, even Loyle’s good luck soon wore thin as he found himself in a criminal’s den, running up a debt that spiraled out of his control. Speaking with the Crime Lord at the center of the ring, Loyle made one last wager, a single unfavored die roll that would either clear his debts, or enslave himself forever to the Crime Lord’s whims. Taking up his sword and laying a kiss on its blade, he rolled the die, which improbably landed in his favor. With a sigh of relief, Loyle left the criminal den. Moments after stepping out, he was improbably crushed by a cow that had fallen loose of the talons of a wyvern far overhead.

When you pick up the blade, you feel your luck greatly improving. However, you also feel a slight undercurrent of dread, sensing that this improvement is not being given, but rather just borrowed from the future. All fortunes balance out in time.

It's difficult to say what the original enchantment placed on the mace was, yet its time within the mimics digestive system seems to have imbued it with properties of the mimic itself. When swung at an enemy, this mace has a chance to ensnare them in the mimic's adhesive ichor or drench them in a mimic's acidic digestive fluids. While a powerful weapon, the Mimic Mace's properties also make it extremely difficult to let go of once picked up, covering the carrier's hand in its sticky coating. It would take a Remove Curse spell to undo this effect.

@146=~Gift of Silence~
@147=~The story of Song and Silence is one told often in the taverns of far away Kara-Tur. The story begins with two twin brothers, born on the border between two lands, one of Light and one of Shadow. Each brother was born with a curious affliction. One brother could only speak in verse and song, and every step or sound they made seemed to accompany a strange melody. The other brother was cursed to silence, never able to speak and whose every step seemed muffled and distant. 

Leaders from the prevailing monasteries on both lands came to the family of the destined brothers. There, they agreed to each take a brother, the Brother of Song to the Monastery of Light and the Brother of Silence to the Monastery of Shadow. There, each brother was raised in accordance with their Monastery’s tenants, each becoming a Monk of their associated order.

The brothers did not meet again until a grand martial arts tournament when both entered as representatives of their Monasteries and faced one another. Stories of what happened here diverge greatly. Some describe the brothers fighting to a standstill until they came to embrace one another. Others say they each struck a mortal blow to the other and died together as one. 

The Brother of Silence was crafted this special Ninjatō by his order that was instilled with his virtues. When wielded, the weapon shrouds its wielder in silence, rendering them mute and muffling every sound they make. Those it strikes are enshrouded in the very same silence.

Still, they hold firm as robes and seem of no danger of melting off your body. Additionally, its wearer always feels a tingle in the tips of their fingers and their small hairs are always standing on edge.

As strange as their make is, what’s even stranger is the effect they have when worn. The robes have a powerful magnetic field around them. This effect repulses all weapon attacks, but especially projectiles. The material of the robes to slide through the air as if lacking any kind of resistance to it at all. Finally, the magnetic aura also seems to amplify the effects of electricity around them. This has a double edged effect; electricity spells cast by the wearer are amplified, but the wearer also suffers a greater vulnerability to those same spells.

While she respected the shield’s role in a warrior’s arsenal as a means of defense, she knew that such cowardly behavior would never earn her god’s favor. In seeking to meld both offense and defense, she created the perfect fusion of both, a shield that provided excellent protection while also spurning the user onwards. Unlike other shields that benefit from a slower approach to battle, the Tempest Targe is meant to be wielded much like a weapon in the off-hand, repelling attacks in one moment while striking enemies the other. The effect is much akin to dual wielding weapons, although with the added protection of a shield in the off-hand.

@165=~Decoded Diary of Riezen Darkeyes~
@166=~*Translator’s note: I’ve gone through and transcribed the most important entries in the volume. Hope this helps, or that you at least find it interesting.

Entry 1 - The Harper leadership has convened and assigned to me the pursuit of the Blackheart, Bhaal’s favored High Priestess during the Time of Troubles. It’s a most confidential mission. I’m not to speak of it to anyone, and should not even be leaving a written record of my task. I only do so under the most carefully devised code that only I or other high ranking Harpers should be able to decipher in the worst case that I cannot accomplish my mission or report back. The details I have been given of Blackheart are as follows:

Known details are as such: 
- Fair of skin 
- Blue eyes 
- Records conflict on hair. Some say brown, others auburn, others bright red. Likely it is dyed as necessary.
- In her priestly regalia, tends towards avian motifs (possibly owl?). It is unlikely she will assume such dress again, however she often will retain feathered adornments on her even in disguise. 
- Lean physique.
- Roughly thirty years of age.
- Her favored weapon is the spear. She was known to fight with it in conjunction with a large clawed gauntlet. 
- She is at least a proficient mage. It is unlikely she retains any divine powers after her god fell, however this does not mean she is not a dangerous enemy. 
- She was last seen within the Marching Mountains of Tethyr

Entry 6 - I have located the Blackheart and begun to trail her. She does not yet know I follow her. However, she has proceeded into the Underdark for some reason I cannot guess at. This is troubling, yet I will continue my task and track her beneath. I only hope that I do not encounter my darkened bastard kin there. 

Entry 9 - I’ve followed the Blackheart for days beneath the earth. Or… perhaps weeks? Time escapes me here. Her destination has revealed itself. She has come to a small shrine, away from the major drow cities. However, the shrine is tended to by other drow. The complex has the markings of Bhaal on them… likely they hide from the Lloth worshiping drow who would destroy a shrine to any surface deity, even one as foul as theirs. She remains in the shrine tending to a young drow woman, I believe educating her. She cannot long be an adult now. She is… rather lovely, despite her dark heritage. 

Entry 13 - I’ve claimed a large cavern in the Underdark as my residence while I observe the Blackheart and her dark prodigy. The mushrooms I tend to and wildlife are adequate to sustain me. I miss the sun, but not so terribly as some of my kin might. I’ve always felt an attraction to the shaded recesses of the below ground. Tending to my mushroom groves, I’ve begun to find new respect for my dark kin.

Entry 18 - I’ve made a terrible error. While I was tending to my groves, I was intruded upon. But while I feared that the vile drow may have discovered me, it was only the single drow girl that Blackheart showed interest in. I know now why. She is a child of the dark god. A Bhaalspawn. I should slay her… it would be my duty as a Harper and as a noble elf. Yet I could not. She’s so beautiful and curious. She did not hate me when she found me. She wished to talk. She even promised not to reveal me to her kin. It is strange. I must watch more.

Entry 19 - She has begun to visit me regularly. Her name is Sendai. I think I love her. 

Entry 22 - Blackheart left the enclave some time ago, but I did not follow. I cannot follow. Perhaps this is an abdication of my mission, but I feel like I must remain here with Sendai. She tells me of her plans, the things she was born to achieve. It scares me because, more and more, I think she speaks truly. I wish for her the destiny she speaks of. 

Entry 29 - This will be my last entry. I have sworn myself to Sendai with all my heart. She sends me on a mission topside… I must destroy an enemy of hers. A Bhaalspawn like her who would ascend before her own plans fall into place. None may steal this inheritance from my love. The Harpers be damned.~

My Redwaters gonna stick down here for a while longer, make sure we're good and fat with loot. We return by next full moon. 

Always loyal,
-Perthag~
